## Overview

This project is designed to showcase a client-server architecture with various components including Java sockets, password encryption, MySQL database integration, and AWT and Swing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture:** The project implements a client-server model, where the client and server communicate using Java sockets. The server is responsible for handling client requests and responding to them.

- **Internationalization:** The project uses the Resource Bundles to support multiple languages. The application is currently available in English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, French, Italian.

- **Password Encryption:** The project incorporates password encryption for enhanced security. It ensures that sensitive information, such as user passwords, is stored securely in the database.

- **MySQL Database Integration:** The project uses a MySQL database to store and manage data. This includes user information, configurations, and other relevant data.

- **AWT and Swing GUIs:** The graphical user interface of the application is built using AWT and Swing. These libraries allow for the creation of user-friendly interfaces for the client-side application.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have the following installed:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK)
   - MySQL Server

2. **Database Setup:** Create a MySQL database and configure the connection settings in the project to match your database server's details.

3. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the server-side code.
   - Compile the client-side code.
   - Run the server program.
   - Run the client program, which will start the GUI.

4. **Usage:** Use the client GUI to interact with the server. You can perform tasks such as user registration, authentication, and other application-specific functionalities.
